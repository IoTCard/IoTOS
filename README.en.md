# 1. About IoTOS

## 1.1 Introduction

IoTOS is an open source IoTCard (IoT card management) system based on SpringBoot, Vue, Mybatis, RabbitMq, Mysql, and Redis, and is a comprehensive solution for enterprise private domain management and operation.

Based on the open capabilities of multiple Internet of Things APIs (such as: China Mobile oneLink, etc.), IoTOS integrates upstream API data synchronization algorithms to provide international solutions.
Through multi-terminal system platform, extreme synchronization algorithm, system architecture business separation, flexible and efficient data operation module, enterprises can establish a strong link with the upstream;
Further diversify management and operations, improve the efficiency of IoT card operations, strengthen operational capabilities, and expand profitable space.

At present, it is mainly used in the Internet of Things communication service industry.

## 1.2 Capabilities

The whole system is temporarily divided into five modules:

* **Homepage**: statistical analysis panel;
* **Connection**: traffic card, equipment, channel operation management configuration view;
* **Account Center**: enterprise, user, role management and distribution authority account;
* **Automation**: automation management rules, templates, push configuration, trigger conditions, etc.;
* **System Management**: menu, parameters, dictionary, system monitoring, system tools, scheduled tasks, etc.;


## 1.3 Advantages

IoTOS is based on the open capability platform of the capability interface of multiple upstream operators, comprehensive business management and operation of IoT cards, but not limited to IoT cards, it can provide API docking management infrastructure for vertical scenarios such as IoT card operations, multiple third-party interface docking requirements, etc. The main advantages are:

* Multilingual international operation (UI interface, background reply, single user's favorite language), robot push (domestic mainstream robot, international mainstream social software)
* High-efficiency API synchronization capabilities use queue multi-thread instances to enable interface multi-threading (add java multi-threading to queue multi-threading) independent specific synchronization algorithm system based on different operator interfaces
* Automation rule definition, rule trigger template, notification configuration, trigger condition, etc.
* The open source protocol adopts Apache-2.0 (users can modify it freely for commercial use, there is no open source requirement)
* Adopt mainstream Java architecture, with high scalability and flexibility
* Provide internal API externally, low-cost secondary development

## 1.4 Vision

IoTOS is not an IoT expert, but allows every enterprise and developer to be its own IoT expert through open source:

* Integrate upstream multi-API basic capabilities, ready to use
* Provide one-stop service operation solutions for vertical industries
* Open up its own platform capabilities to allow more developers to participate
* Work with enterprises and developers to help the Internet of Things industry to build and develop the future
